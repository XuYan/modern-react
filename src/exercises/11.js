/**
 * React Hooks can only be used in function component. You cannot use them in class component.
 * The only place hooks are allowed to be used is in the rendering phase of a function component. DO NOT use hooks in callbacks, etc.
 *
 * DO NOT use hooks conditionally
 * because the order of hooks matter, when Component gets re-rendered, React does not know whatâ€™s the right value to return.
 *
 * DO NOT use hooks in loops.
 *
 * Cannot call hooks outside a function body of a function component.
